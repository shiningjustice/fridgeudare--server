# Fridg路u路Dare Server App
***Created by Phoebe Law***

## Description
Fridg路u路Dare was born from a desire to *1. reduce food waste* and *2. save time and money*. By keeping an inventory of what's in your fridge, visually aging items by item type, and keeping this as simple as possible, users should be able to accomplish both goals in a feasible way. This can be accomplished by helping you see what you have and if it's going bad (so you don't forget to buy something/don't forget that you already have something) and by helping you see if you have food you can finish before going out to eat. An secondary use for this is maintaining a clean fridge - being able to quickly see what is too old will prevent anything from going bad for too long (e.g., if tupperware is hiding behind the gallon of milk). 

Additionally, this app can be scaled to include API support to simplify adding items to your list (specifically scanning barcodes to auto add item to the right category).
